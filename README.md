# Deploying to Heroku

First: I had to change gem 'sqlite3' to gem 'Pg'; a colleague advised to install PG and fix db from "database.yml"

Second: I had to change ruby version to be able to push to heroku; a colleague advised to install a new Ruby version.

Third: An error kept annoying me which is "Your Ruby version is xxx but your Gemfile specified xxx"; so a colleague advised to change bin file from #!/usr/bin/env ruby2.7 to #!/usr/bin/env ruby

Forth: To push from Feature2 branch, I had to go to Heroku.com, connect to github, choose branch and debloy. 
Fifth: There was an error "twitter page not showing"; open the project from Heroku and choose "rails console"
